### üåç Why Food Waste Management?

Food waste is a global issue with local solutions. This app connects **providers** (restaurants, grocery stores) with **receivers** (NGOs, shelters) to reduce waste and redistribute surplus food.

It supports:
- Viewing real-time data  
- Running smart analytics  
- Empowering communities through food recovery  

Let's create a sustainable, hunger-free world! üåæ
